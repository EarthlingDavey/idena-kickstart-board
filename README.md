# Intro

This is a place for project management documents and tracking related to the Idena Kickstarter project.

## Idena community developers

These documents are intended for use by Idena community developers.
If you would like to contribute, join the [Idena Discord server](https://discord.gg/cyWs66H) and say hi in the Community Dev #general-discussion channel.

## Editing these documents

I am using the Prettier plugin with default settings, for consistency please consider using the same.

# Idena Kickstarter

Basically, it is a website to enable funding of community projects.

The community will be able to:

- discover
- share (?)
- discuss (?)
- vote on
- donate towards in \$DNA
- monitor progress

The most part of the site will have similar function to the well known kickstarter.com

The main difference to kickstarter.com will be voting. Community members will be encouraged to vote on projects. This voting will influence the core Idena foundation co-funding.

Due to the nature of Idena network, 1 vote will be one person. Many votes of small amounts of $DNA will equate to more co-funding, compared to fewer votes of lots of $DNA.

See the official release [Community-based co-funding](https://medium.com/idena/community-based-co-funding-b6b4fc79ddff) for background reading, including rues of funding.

## Who will be using it, and what are the considerations?

### Idena community for voting

The Idena community are what makes Idena what it is. The website is being built for them. I assume they wil be the biggest user group by population - It will be used by them the most.

We are asking for their time, effort and money and during the project they should be valued accordingly.

### Developers/makers/people looking for funding

This group of people will help the network grow quickly. We are asking developers to take a small risk by spending time on writing a proposal, which could ultimately be denied funding.

Developers will value (IMO):

- a quick and easy process for application
- easy way to communicate ideas, text and images
- a place for organised discussion
- feedback from voters, especially for 'no' votes
- support from admin on using the website (throughout the funding process)
- a place to show their skill set - maybe a profile template to complete

It should be clear which developers have a good reputation, as a poorly executed project could damage the reputation of the project or Idena as a whole.

### Potential new community developers

The website could be one of the first impressions for this user group. They will likely appreciate a well made website using solid tech.

### Potential new community members (non-developers)

Likewise, new community members will visit the site. It may be linked from the Idena homepage. First impressions should be a priority for this group of users.

### Admin / website management

This group don't need a great design for user interface. They do however need something that is:

- easy to use
- well documented
- scalable - quick to use even if there are many proposals
- 100% reliable

## What specific functions does it have to do?

From an end-user point of view (a non developer):

1. Explain itself. What is the site, who is it for and how to use it?
1. Present projects for discovery
1. Detail each project
1. Each project will have a unique Idena wallet address
1. Donations to these addresses will count as votes
1. Confirmation of voting
1. Display clearly how voting has been cast on each project
1. Display current co-funding amount based on the Idena foundation formula
1. After donations, users should be kept in the loop of updates (email?)
1. To encourage community, progress updates and case studies of completed projects
1. Easy to share content

For a developer

1. Explain the process of how to ask for money
1. Explain the value of developers in Idena
1. Show examples of other projects
1. Try and communicate the potential of Idena
1. Encourage chatting through project ideas in Discord chat?
1. Monitoring of funding progress
1. A way to receive funding
1. A way to provide updates of a project once it's started
1. Support from admin or other community developers, e.g. with git

For potential new community and developers

1. Easily see what the Kickstarter project is about
1. Browse, filter(?), search(?)
1. Share
1. Join the community

For admin

1. See an overview of all projects
1. When projects are funded, communicate with Idena foundation and transfer funds to developer
1. For underfunded projects, issue refunds
1. Share & push (email) updates for Kickstarter in general or specific projects
