# Idena Kickstarter

Basically, it is a website to enable finding of community projects.

The community will be able to:

- discover
- discuss (?)
- vote on
- donate towards in \$DNA
- monitor progress

The most part of the site will have similar function to the well known kickstarter.com

The main difference to kickstarter.com will be voting. Community members will be encouraged to vote on projects. This voting will influence the core Idena foundation co-funding.

Due to the nature of Idena network, 1 vote will be one person. Many votes of small amounts of $DNA will equate to more co-funding, compared to fewer votes of lots of $DNA.

See the official release [Community-based co-funding](https://medium.com/idena/community-based-co-funding-b6b4fc79ddff) for background reading, including rues of funding.
