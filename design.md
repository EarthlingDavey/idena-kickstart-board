# Bingbinglee's Proposal - Frontend and UX Design

## Overview
Any project / web application today is aimed to be built for scale and has to be universally usable and understood by users from all walks of life. 
I would like to take the same approach of human-centered design to do user experience and interaction design work for the community funding platform aka Idena-kickstarter.

In the interest of transparency, I am asking for 135 USD / day (my reduced freelance rate) for the work being done for Idena project. It will take around 6-8 days of work part-time resulting in 22-24 hours of my time going into the project. 

## What methodology would I use? 

### 1. UI design
Platform of choice: [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) & Figma

I will be making mockups on a standard 1366 x 768 web template via sketch and then will be making a clickable prototype of the application in marvel which will be highly detailed and 1:1 comparison of the final project. 

### 2. Clickable interactive prototype
Platform of choice: HTML/CSS

I will be putting together the prototype using vanilla html/css. This can be quickly iterated upon based on feedback and can be used for direct reference in building react components as mentioned in the next steps.

### 3. Frontend
Platform of choice1: React

Assuming the platform will be built in react, I will be contributing to help build the first set of common components as well as putting together page composites for the page flows. I do not expect this to have more than 12-15 unique pages from the start. Refer to ccs.monero.org to have an estimate. 

This will be done once I am able to deliver everything mentioned above Frontend section and/or if the time limit further permits.
